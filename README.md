# Poly3D-Reader
Object oriented Perl scripts to parse, create, and edit Poly3D input/output files ([Poly3D](https://github.com/stgl/poly3d) is a Boundary Element Method Geomechanics software that is applicable to a wide variety of problems related to fault slip).

These scripts were written for a PhD project at the Unversity of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Please feel free to modify for your own purposes.  See the commented header section in [Poly3DReader.pm](https://github.com/Ryshackleton/Poly3D-Reader/blob/master/Poly3dReader.pm) for documentation of specific methods, and see all of the *.pl scripts for examples of how to parse/retrieve different parts of the Poly3D input/output files.

These scripts are very old now, but please feel free to contact [Ryan](mailto:ryan@shackletoncomputing.com "Send Ryan an Email") with questions.
